# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring the existing win post card layout to improve visual hierarchy, readability, and user experience. The new layout will reorganize information in a more logical flow, starting with user identification, followed by the visual content, and then detailed information about the win. The design emphasizes clear typography, proper spacing, and conditional display of optional elements.
