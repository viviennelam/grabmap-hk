# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive typography system for the grabmap-hk React application that supports both English and Chinese text with modern, clean styling using Poppins for headers and Inter for body text. The system prioritizes English fonts with Chinese fallbacks and maintains consistent spacing and sizing across the application.

2. WHEN the application loads THEN all H2 elements SHALL use 'Poppins', 'Helvetica Neue', 'Noto Sans TC', sans-serif font family
3. WHEN displaying H1 text THEN the system SHALL apply 2rem font size with 700 font weight
4. WHEN displaying H2 text THEN the system SHALL apply 1.5rem font size with 700 font weight

6. WHEN displaying Chinese header text THEN the system SHALL apply normal letter-spacing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user reading content in the application, I want body text to be clean and readable in both English and Chinese, so that I can easily consume information regardless of language.

2. WHEN displaying body text THEN the system SHALL apply 1rem font size with 400 font weight

4. WHEN displaying any text THEN the system SHALL apply 1.5 line-height for optimal readability
5. WHEN displaying body text THEN the system SHALL apply normal letter-spacing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with different language preferences, I want the application to properly display both English and Chinese text with appropriate font fallbacks, so that content is always readable regardless of my system's font availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN English fonts are available THEN the system SHALL prioritize English fonts in the font stack
2. WHEN English fonts are unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to Chinese fonts (Noto Sans TC)
3. WHEN no specified fonts are available THEN the system SHALL fallback to system sans-serif fonts
4. WHEN displaying mixed language content THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent line-height of 1.5
5. WHEN rendering text THEN the system SHALL ensure proper font loading and display

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the application interface, I want a clean and professional appearance without distracting elements, so that I can focus on the content and functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application renders any text THEN the system SHALL NOT display any emoji characters
2. WHEN applying typography styles THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent visual hierarchy
3. WHEN displaying content THEN the system SHALL ensure professional appearance across all components
4. WHEN users view the interface THEN the system SHALL provide clear distinction between header and body text styles
